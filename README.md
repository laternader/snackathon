# Snackathon
The app is to "stumble upon" recipes with the click of a button. The interface of this webapp will be easy for those who are elderly/technologically incapable yet child's play for those who are able to navigate. Once the button is clicked is where features come in like adding one's own recipes, being able to share it, constant asking of yes or no questions, etc.
