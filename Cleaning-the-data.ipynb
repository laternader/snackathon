It's great and that's all that I care about! This is a large cake, so make sure you have the right pan/s for it. I don't really know what size pan to tell you to use. One look at the ingredients will tell you it's going to be huge. I plan to make this in the next week or so, and when I do, I'll come back and post.

I buy Swiss Miss No-Sugar-Added Cocoa in bulk when Costco puts it on sale at the end of the season. I squeeze the caramel topping for 5 counts for DH and 3 counts for me. When I can't find hazelnut flavored syrup, I use the vanilla flavor; we miss that flavor accent if I omit it.  This recipe fills one 18-to-20-ounce travel mug.

You may use more or less than 1 pound of sausages if desired, I just use 1 can for the 1-1/2 cups of sliced mushrooms for this recipe, but 2 cans can be used if desired.

Our DIL has been quite ill and miserable so when she requested Brussels sprouts, we both frozen as fresh are out of season. I think this would be even better with fresh. The original recipe used far more bacon, contained spinach and din't have the tomato paste or mustard in it.\",\n",

I have made this recipe with boneless pork loin, boneless pork loin roast, and also with pork sirloin roast that has a bone in it-all are good.   The timing here does not include MARINATING it overnight.   If you prefer more of a lemony taste in your pork gravy, go ahead and increase the lemon juice.  I also prefer the lower amount of thyme but you might want to up it.  I marinate this in a small oven cooking bag that I plan on roasting it in.  I like to serve it with roasted potatoes and baby carrots -I put that in for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.\",\n",

When I can't find hazelnut flavored syrup, I use the vanilla flavor; we miss that flavor accent if I omit it.  This recipe fills one 18-to-20-ounce travel mug.
